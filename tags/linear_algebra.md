# Things to remember

`Spectral Theorem`
- Normal matrices has full real eigenvalues, and can be decomposed into \\(UDU^*\\) form

`Schur's Lemma`
If \\(A\\) is any square complex matrix, then there is an upper triangular complex matrix \\(T\\) and a unitary \\(U\\) such that
\\[A=UTU^*=UTU^\{âˆ’1\}\\]

Orthogonal - Unitary

Symmetric - Hermitian


<a href="https://linear_algebra/2018/05/09/orthogonality.html" target="_blank">If set of vectors are mutually orthogonal, then they are mutually independent.</a>


4 Fundamental subspaces
* nullspace \\(\perp\\) row space
* left nullspace \\(\perp\\) column space
* row operations
  * does not change the nullspace
  * does not change the dependencies between columns
* \\(Ax=b\\) is solvable when
  * b is in the column space
  * b is in the orthogonal complement of the left nullspace. that is, \\[x^TA=0\quad\rightarrow\quadx^Tb=0\\]
