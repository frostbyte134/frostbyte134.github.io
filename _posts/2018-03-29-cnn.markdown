Convolutional Neural Networks (LeCun, 1989, `CNN`) are neural nets for processing of grid-like topology.

Convolution is a linear operation. So it can be described in terms of linear layer as \\[ \phi(W^Tx+b) \to \phi((x\*f) + b)\\]

where \\(f\\) is some filter.

Usually, the colvolution in deep learning does not correspond precisely to the defiintion of convolution in other fields.



<h3 id="conv_op">(1) The convolution operation</h3>
\\[S(t)=\int x(a)w(t-a)da = \sum_{a=-\infty}^{\infty}x(a)w(t-a)\\] where \\(x(a)\\) is referred as `input`, \\(w(t-a)\\) as the `kernel`, and the output is sometimes referred as the `feature map`.

In ML application, \\(x(a)\\) and \\(w(t-a)\\) are usually tensors (__link?__).



We often use convolution over more than one axis a time. Ex) \\[ S(i,j) = (I\*K)(i,j)=\sum_m{\sum_n{I(m,n)K(i-m,j-n)}}\\]

Convolution is "commutative", so that

\\[(I\*K)(i, j) = (K\*I)(i,j)\\] The only reason we flip the kernel is to make it commutative.



Cross-correlation function: no kernel flipping in convolution. Many ML libraries implement cross-correlation but call it convolution.
Since Discrete convolution is a linear opeariton, there there exists 1-1 correspondence (link, Rudin analysis) to Toeplitz matrix). \\[(x\*w)(t)=\sum\_{a=-\infty}^{\infty}x(a)w(t-a) \\] \\[(x\*w)(t) = \cdots + x(-1)w(t+1) + x(0)w(t) + x(1)w(t-1) + \cdots  \\] \\[(x\*w)(t+1) = \cdots + x(-1)w(t) + x(0)w(t+1) + x(1)w(t) + \cdots \\] \\[ \Longrightarrow \begin{bmatrix}   \vdots  \\\ (x\*w)(t) \\\   (x\*w)(t+1) \\\ \vdots \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}   \\\ \cdots & w(t+1) & w(t) & w(t-1) & \cdots \\\  \cdots & w(t+2) & w(t+1) & w(t) & \cdots  \\\ & \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}   \vdots  \\\ x(-1) \\\   x(0) \\\ x(1) \\\ \vdots \end{bmatrix}\\]
