### Definition
> __Definition__ 3.21 (PMA):  
Given a sequence \\(\\{a\_n\\}\\), we associate __a seequence__ \\(\\{s\_n\\}\\) (=`partial sum`), where
\\[s\_n=\sum\_\{k=1\}^na\_k.\\]

For \\(\\{s\_n\\}\\), we use the symbolic expression
\\[a\_1+a\_2+...\\] 
or, more __consicesly__
\\[\sum\_\{k=1\}^\infty a\_n.\tag\{4\}\\]
The symbol (4) we call an `infinite series`, or just a `series`. If \\(\\{s\_n\\}\\) __converges to __ \\(s\\), then we say that the __series converges__, and write
\\[\sum\_\{k=1\}^\infty a\_n = s\\]
The number \\(s\\) is called the sum of the series; but it should be clearly understood that \\(s\\) __is the limit of a sequence__ of sums, and __is not obtained simply by addition__. If \\(\\{s\_n\\}\\) diverges, the series is said to be diverge.

The term (4) is sometimes abbreviated as \\(\sum a\_n\\), including the case where \\(n\\) starts with 0.

### Series and Cauchy sequence
It is clear that every theorem about sequences can be stated in terms of series, as the following thereom and vice versa.

The <a href="{{site.url}}/analysis/2018/12/29/cauchy-seq.html" target="_blank">Cauchy criterion (PMA Thm 3.11)</a> can be restated as follows.

> __Theorem__ 3.22 (PMA) \\(\sum a\_n\\) converges i.i.f for every \\(\epsilon\\), there is an integer \\(N\\) such that
\\[\| \sum\_\{k=n\}^m a\_k \| < \epsilon\tag\{6\}\\]
\\(\forall\\ m\geq n \geq N\\)

__proof__: remember that the partial sum \\(\\{s\_n\\}\\)s are sequence

In particular, by taking \\(m=n\\), we see that (6) becomes
\\[\|a\_n\| < \epsilon\\]
Which can be stated as below

> __Theorem__ 3.23 (PMA) If \\(\sum a\_n\\) converges, then 
\\[\lim\_\{n\rightarrow\infty\}\|a\_n\| = 0\\]

The __converse is not true__ for some cases (ex - \\(\sum 1/n\\). For the proof we refer to `Thm 3.28`).

> __Theorem__ 3.24 (PMA) A series of nonnegative terms converges i.i.f its partial sum form a bounded sequence.

__proof__: `Thm 3.14`, concerning monotonic sequences, also has in immediate counterpart for series non-negative (or positive) series, since their partial sums are monotonic.

### Comparison Test
> __Theorem__ 3.25  __Comparison test__  
(a) If \\(\|a\_n\| \leq c\_n\\) for \\(n\geq N\_0\\), where \\(N\_0\\) is some fixed integer, and if \\(\sum c\_n\\) converges, than \\(\sum a\_n\\) converges.  
(b) Can be proved in many ways, (ex - `Thm 3.24`) considering the partial sums

__proof__  
(a) \\(\sum c\_n\\) converges - partial sums of \\(c\_n\\) converges - using some inequalities, partial sums of \\(a\_n\\) converges.  
(b) If \\(a\_n\geq d\_n\geq 0\\) for \\(n\geq N\_0\\), and if \\(\sum d\_n\\)  diverges, then \\(\sum a\_n\\)  diverges

### Series of Nonnegative Terms
Here only the theorems are listed. For the exact proof, refer to the book.

> __Theorem__ 3.26  __Geometric Series__   
If \\(0\leq x\leq 1\\), then
\\[\sum\_\{n=1\}^\infty x^n=\frac\{1\}\{1-x\}\\]
If \\(x\leq 1\\), the series diverges

__proof__: If \\(x\neq 1\\),
\\[s\_n=\sum\_\{k=1\}^n x^k=\frac\{1-x^\{n+1\}\}\{1-x\}\\]
The result follows if we let \\(n\rightarrow\infty\\). For \\(x=1\\), the series obviously diverges.

The following theorem of Cauchy is therefore of particular interest. The striking feature of the theorem is that a rather `thin subsequence` of \\(a\_n\\) determines the convergence or divergence of \\(\sum a\_n\\).

> __Theorem__ 3.27   
Suppose \\(a\_1\geq a\_2 \geq \cdots \geq 0\\). Then the series \\(sum\_\{n=1\}^\infty a\_n\\)  converges i.i.f the series
\\[\sum\_\{k=0\}^\infty 2^ka\_\{2^k\}\\]
converges

__proof__: we can bound each other's partial sums, using the finite sum of geometric sequences.

> __Theorem__ 3.28 	
\\(\sum \frac\{1\}\{n^p\}\\) converges if \\(p>1\\) and diverges if \\(p≤1\\)

1. If \\(p\leq 0\\), theorem 3.23 is applicable.
2. If \\(p>1\\), Theorem 3.27 is applicable, which gives the series
\\[\sum\_\{k=0\}^\infty 2^k \frac\{1\}\{2^\{kp\}\}=\sum\_\{k=0\}^\infty 2^\{(1-p)k\}\\]
Now, \\(2^\{1-p\}<1 \\) i.i.f \\(1-p<0\\), and the result follows from the comparison test with geometric seq.

> __Theorem__ 3.29 	
\\(\sum \frac\{1\}\{n(\log n)^p\}\\) converges if \\(p>1\\) and diverges if \\(p≤1\\).
