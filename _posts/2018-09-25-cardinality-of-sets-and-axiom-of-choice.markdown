### Finite/Infinite Sets and Enumerable sets

For two sets \\(A, B\\), if an <a href="{{site.url}}//analysis/2018/09/25/function.html#oto_corr" target="_blank">one-to-one correspondence</a> \\(f:A\mapsto B\\) exists then we say \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are `equinumerous`, denoted by \\(A\approx B\\). By the property of one-to-one correspondence, __equinumerous relation is a equivalent relation__ of arbitrary family of sets.

If there exists \\(n\in \mathbb\{Z\}\\) such that a set \\(E\\) is equinumerous to a set \\(\\{0,1,...,n\\}\\), or \\(E=\emptyset\\), we say that \\(E\\) is `finite`. Formally speaking, let \\(w:=\\{k\in \mathbb\{Z\} \\ \| \\ k\geq 0\\},\\  w\_k:=\\{k\in \mathbb\{Z\} \\ \| \\ 0\leq k \leq n\\}\\).  
Then \\(E\\) is a countable set when
\\[\exists n \in w \\ : \\ E\approx w\_n.\\]

* A set which is not finite is `infinite`.
* By enumerating its elements, we see that some subset of an arbitrary infinite set is equinumerious with the \\(\mathbb\{N\}\\).
* A set equinumerious with \\(\mathbb\{N\}\\) is called a `enumerable set`. __Enumerable set is the smallest infinite set.__ We call finite sets and enumerable sets as the `countable set.
\\[\text\{finite \lor enumerable = countable\}\\]

Following are some properties of the finite/infinite sets.
* \\(E\\) is an infinit set = \\(E\\) has enumerable set
