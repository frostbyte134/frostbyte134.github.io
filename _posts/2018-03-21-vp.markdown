>Virtual point (VP) is a point where [2D projection of the] set of lines in 3D space converge.

### Definitions
- If two lines are parallel in 3D space, they share same VP  
(We don't need two parallel lines to define a VP. Two parallel lines happen to share same VP)
- If we project "a line" on 3D space into image plane, it's limit is the vanishing line  
(Think it must be orthogonal to z-axis to have a representable limit)
- Consider a set S of {set of parallel lines}.  
If \\(a,b,c\in S\\) (\\(a\\): set of parallel lines, \\(b\\): another set of parallel lines, ...) are not parallel, then they don't share same VP.  
- However, if they're on a same plane, their VPs form a line (Vanishing line). Actually, if they (a, b, c) are on parallel planes, their VPs form a line.  
__Two parallel lines share same VP, and Two parallel planes share same VL__  
VP of the optical axis is the `principal point`(__add link plz__). All lines parallel to the optical axis have principal point as VP.  


### Interesting stuffs
Ex) `Horizontal line`  
Think about a 'plane' parallel to the ground, encompassing the optical axis.
In below picture, it is represented as a line encompassing L.

|:--:| 
| Image from [2] |

Intersection of such plane with image plane forms a 'line', which is represented as a point L in above picture. It is a vanishing line, a horizontal line in image.

In the image, for every point below L, no matter how long we extend the line (from C, passing such point), the line will eventually touch the ground and the pixel of such point will be represented as a ground.

Height of the camera is independent with the position of the vanishing line of horizontal plane. Only the pitch, yaw, rolling matters.
![VP_horiz]({{ site.url }}/images/math/geometry/horizontal_lines_of_vp.png){: .center-image }

If we know a vanishing point, we can find out extrinsic parameters (pitch, yaw, rolling) and intrinsic parameters (focal length and principal points)
