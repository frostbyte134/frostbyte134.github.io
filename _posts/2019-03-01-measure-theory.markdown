TODO
* complement `Banach-Tarski` paradox


### Why measure theory?

Consider a 3d ball, and we split the ball into pieces. Under the `ZFC` axiom, there exists a way which we can reproduce 2 balls with same volume.  
\\(\rightarrow\\) Banach-Tarski paradox


We resolve this paradox by
1. discard `C`: axiom of choice. (not recommended)
2. only consider `measureable sets`.  
Non-measurable sets - cannot assign any meaningful measure.


### Sigma-algebra

\\(\sigma\\)-algebra

Def: Given a set \\(\Omega\\), a \\(\sigma\\)-algebra on \\(\Omega\\) is a __collection__ of sets \\(\mathscr\{A\}\subset 2^\{\Omega\}\\) with following properties
1. \\(\mathscr\{A\}\\) is not empty
2. for its elements \\(A\in\mathscr\{A\}\\), \\(\mathscr\{A\}\\) is closed under the complement
3. for its elements \\(A\in\mathscr\{A\}\\), \\(\mathscr\{A\}\\) is closed under the countable union

Remarks
* \\(\Omega\in\mathscr\{A\}\\).  
\\(\mathscr\{A\}\\) is not empty \\(\rightarrow\\) for some set \\(E\in\mathscr\{A\}\\), using 2 and 3, \\(E\bigcup E^C\in\mathscr\{A\}\\).
* \\(\emptyset\in\mathscr\{A\}\\) - use above and 2
* A member of \\(\sigma\\)-alg \\(\mathscr\{A\}\\) is closed under the countable intersection.  
\\(\rightarrow\\) use 3, 2 and De morgan's law

### Generated sigma-algebra
Def: Given \\(C\subset2^\{\Omega\}\\), the `sigma-algebra generated by C`, denoted by \\(\sigma(C)\\), is the __smallest__ \\(\sigma\\)-alg containing \\(C\\).
\\[\sigma(C):=\bigcap\_\{\mathscr\{A\}: C\subset \mathscr\{A\}\}\mathscr\{A\}\\]

Remarks
* \\(\sigma\\)-alg always exists, b/c
	1. Powerset of nonempty set \\(\Omega\\) is always non-empty - the intersection in the definition is always nonempty
	2. Any intersection of \\(\sigma\\)-alg is always a \\(\sigma\\)-alg

Examples
1. \\(\mathscr\{A\}\\): \\(\\{\emptyset,\\ \Omega\\}\\)
1. \\(\mathscr\{A\}\\): \\(\\{\emptyset,\\ E,\\ E^C\\, \Omega\\}\\)
1. If \\(\Omega=\Re\\), the `Borel sigma-algebra` is a \\(\sigma\\)-alg \\(\mathbb:=\sigma(\tau)\\), where \\(\tau\\) is the set of all open sets in real line.

### Measure
Def: A `measure` \\(\mu\\) on \\(\Omega\\) with (a set in?) \\(\sigma\\)-algebra \\(\mathscr\{A\}\\) is __a function__ \\[\mu\\ : \\ \mathscr\{A\} \mapsto [0,\infty]\\] such that
1. \\(\mu(\emptyset)=0\\)
2. `countable additivity`
\\[\mu\left(\bigcap\_\{i=1\}^\{\infty\}E\_i\right)=\sum\_\{i=1\}^\{\infty\} \mu(E\_i)\\] for any pairwise disjoint \\(E\_1,E\_2,...\subset \mathscr\{A\}\\)

Def: a `probability measure` \\(P\\) is a measure s.t. \\[P(\Omega)=1\\]
