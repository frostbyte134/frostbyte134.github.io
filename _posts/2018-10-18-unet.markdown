### Abstract, Introduction
* a network training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation
* The architecture consists of 
	* a contracting path to capture context
	* a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization
* end to end trainable
* `localization`: a class label is supposed to be assigned to each pixel.


### Architecture

* No Dense layer
* No padding in convs of contracting path 
* expanding path is concatenated with the __correspondingly cropped__ feature map from the contrating path  
\\(\rightarrow\\) the cropping is necessary due to the loss of border pixels in every conv.
* ? To allow a seamless tiling of the output segmentation map, it is important to select the inout tile size such that all 2by2 max pool are applied to a lyer with an even x-and y-size.


### Miscs
* Training - one batch per image  
\\(\rightarrow\\) __high momentum of SGD__ such that a large # of the prev seen traininhg samples determine the update in the current optimization step.
* Multiplied weight map to the log-likelihood  
weight: gaussian-like (inverse)distance to two nearest border pixels
\\(\rightarrow\\) Pixles near the border get high weight
