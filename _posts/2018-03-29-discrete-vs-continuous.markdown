In a `topological space`,  
1. Accumulation point: A point x of a topological space S is an accumulated point, iif for any open ball Bx where x∈Bx holds, ∃ an element y∈S such that y∈Bx.
2. Isolated point: A point x∈S which is not an accumulated point is isolated.
3. Discrete: A topological space is discrete, if it contains no accumulation point.
4. Continuous: A topological space is continuous, if it is composed with accumulation points only.

Note that, there could be a set which is __not discrete nor continuous.__not
