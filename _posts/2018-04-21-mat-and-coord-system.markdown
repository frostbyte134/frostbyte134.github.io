__The concept of diagonal matrix is dependent on the choice of coordinate system.__

Namely, an linear mapping \\(\vec{y}=f(\vec{x})\\) is represented as \\(y=Dx\\) with a diagonal matrix \\(D\\), but is represented as \\(y'=Ax'\\) with an ordinary matrix \\(A\\) in another coordinate system. In the former system calculation gets prettier, and we need to figure out how we can find such a good basis.



However, __the concept of Identity matrices / zero matrices are defined independently from the choice of coordinate system.__ Indeed, identity matrix corresponds to a linear mapping \\(f\\) where \\(f(\vec{x})=x\\), and zero matrices corresponds to a linear mapping \\(f\\) where \\(f(\vec{x})=0\\).
