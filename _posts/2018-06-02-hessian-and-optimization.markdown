### Hessian and gradient method
The directional second deritive \\(f\'\'(u)\\) with unit direction \\(u\\), which can be calculated with the Hessian \\(H\\) by \\(u^THu\\), __tells us how well we can expect a gradient step to perform__.

Consider the 2nd-order Taylor approximation (link plz) to the function \\(f(x)\\) arount the current point \\(x^\{(0)\}\\).
