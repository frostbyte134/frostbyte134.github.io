해석학부터 다시 봐야하는거 아닌가?..closure도 잘 기억이 안나는데?

### Chap 1

Proposition 1.1.1:  
(b) Vector sum C_1+C_2 of two convex sets C_1 and C_2 is convex.  
(c) The set λC is convex for any convex set C and scalar λ. Furthermore, if C is convex set and λ_1, λ_2 are positive scalars, (λ_1+λ_2 )C=λ_1 C+λ_2 C.  
(d) The closure and the interior of a convex set are convex.
