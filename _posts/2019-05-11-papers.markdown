### Style Transfer

#### Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Backpropagation [5]
* optimization based
* refercenced in [3]
  * introduce an optimization scheme involving backpropagation for performing content preserving style transfer

#### CycleGAN [7]
* refercenced in [3]
    * performs __unpaired__ img2img translation by employing adversarial losses and cycle consistency losses

#### Photographic Image Synthesis with Cascaded Refinement Networks [9]
* <a href="{{site.url}}/deep_learning/2019/05/08/crn-perceptual.html" target="_blank">review</a>
* Used perceptual loss [6] only (No GAN)
* Motivated by __Deep generative image models using a Laplacian pyramid of adversarial networks, NIPS, 2015__ : trained multiple separate GANs, one for each lvl in a Laplacian pyramid. Each model is trained independently to synthesize details at its scale. Assembling separately trained models in this fashion enabled the authors to synthesize imgs up to 96 by 96 
* As a baseline, used [10]


### Perceptual loss related

#### Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super Resolution [6]
* <a href="{{site.url}}/deep_learning/2019/05/08/perceptual-loss-style-transfer.html" target="_blank">review</a>  

#### Generating images with perceptual similarity metrics based on ddep networks [11]
* Referenced in [3]
  * introduced a family of composite loss functions for img synthesis, which combine regression over the activations of a fixed "perceiver" network with a GAN loss. Network trained using these composite loss functions were applied to synthesize preimages that include desired excitation patterns in img classification models [11] and imgs that ecites specific elements in such models.

### Domain Adaptation

#### Unsupervised Domain Adaptaion using Backpropagation [1]
* <a href="{{site.url}}/deep_learning/2019/01/18/gdl.html" target="_blank">review</a>  
* `Gradient Reversial Layer`
* Referenced in [3]
    * ...performs domain adaptation by applying adversarial losses in the feature space

#### FCNs in the wild [2]
* Reference in [3]
    * D operates directly on the feature space.
    * proposes two alignmet strategies
        1. global alignment which is an extension to the Gradient Reversal Layer [1]
        2. local alignment which aligns class specific statistics by formulating it as a multiple isntance learning problem.

#### Learning from Synthetic Data: Addressing Domain Shift for Semantic Segmentation [3]
* <a href="{{site.url}}/deep_learning//2019/05/11/learning-from-synthetic-data.html" target="_blank">review</a>
* CVPR 2018
* with GAN + feature representation, __targets segmentation__ + `Unsupervised Domain Adaptation`
* Proposed `style transfer` \\(\rightarrow\\) `domain adaptation`  
    > One possible direction to address the domain adaptation problem is to __employ style transfer__ or __dross-domain mapping network__ to stylize the source domain images as target and __train the segmentation models in this stylized space__.
* Sort of __gradient reversial__ between different domains (set the label to false)


#### Curriculum domain adaptation for semantic segmentation of urban scenes [4]
* Referenced in [3]
   * curriculum-style learning approach
     * easy task of estimating blobal label distributions over imgs and local distribution over landmark superpixel is learnt first
     * the segnet is then trained so that the target label distribution follow these inferred label properties

#### Cross-gradient
#### Generalizing to Unseen Domains via Adversarial Data Augmentation
#### No More Discrimination: Cross City Adaptation of Road Scene Segmenters
#### Cycada: Cycle-consistent adversarial domain adaptation
