### Style Transfer

#### Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Backpropagation [5]
* optimization based
* refercenced in [3]
  * introduce an optimization scheme involving backpropagation for performing content preserving style transfer

#### Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super Resolution [6]
* <a href="{{site.url}}/deep_learning/2019/05/08/perceptual-loss-style-transfer.html" target="_blank">review</a>  

#### CycleGAN [7]
* refercenced in [3]
    * performs __unpaired__ img2img translation by employing adversarial losses and cycle consistency losses


### Domain Adaptation

#### Unsupervised Domain Adaptaion using Backpropagation [1]
* <a href="{{site.url}}/deep_learning/2019/01/18/gdl.html" target="_blank">review</a>  
* `Gradient Reversial Layer`
* Referenced in [3]
    * ...performs domain adaptation by applying adversarial losses in the feature space

#### FCNs in the wild [2]
* Reference in [3]
    * D operates directly on the feature space.
    * proposes two alignmet strategies
        1. global alignment which is an extension to the Gradient Reversal Layer [1]
        2. local alignment which aligns class specific statistics by formulating it as a multiple isntance learning problem.

#### Learning from Synthetic Data: Addressing Domain Shift for Semantic Segmentation [3]
* <a href="{{site.url}}/deep_learning/2019/05/08/crn-perceptual.html" target="_blank">review</a>
* CVPR 2018
* with GAN + feature representation, __targets segmentation__ + `Unsupervised Domain Adaptation`
* Proposed `style transfer` \\(\rightarrow\\) `domain adaptation` 
> One possible direction to address the domain adaptation problem is to __employ style transfer__ or __dross-domain mapping network__ to stylize the source domain images as target and __train the segmentation models in this stylized space__.


#### Curriculum domain adaptation for semantic segmentation of urban scenes [4]
* Referenced in [3]
   * curriculum-style learning approach
     * easy task of estimating blobal label distributions over imgs and local distribution over landmark superpixel is learnt first
     * the segnet is then trained so that the target label distribution follow these inferred label properties

#### Cross-gradient
#### Generalizing to Unseen Domains via Adversarial Data Augmentation
#### No More Discrimination: Cross City Adaptation of Road Scene Segmenters
#### Cycada: Cycle-consistent adversarial domain adaptation
