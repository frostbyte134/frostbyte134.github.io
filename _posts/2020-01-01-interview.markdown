Feedback
My recruiter said my communication skills are highly rated, especially in articulating complicated logic, defining inputs, outputs, and corner cases. However, the speed of problem solving, as well as optimality of solutions have not passed the bar yet.

Insights
Since my strengths are about communications, I would like to share some unique insights about coding communication (especially for some companies that require you to code on a shared document), that I have learnt from the interviews, instead of directly posting the questions here due to NDA.

1. Expect differnet styles of interviewers

High-frequency leetcode solvers may be confident enough to solve a question given a well-defined statement, with inputs and outputs clearly stated. However, not all interviewers will give you such a well-formatted setting. In fact, most are intentionally giving vague instructions. From my experiences, there are these few types of interviewers and you would apply different frameworks for each of them.

Type 1: The interviewer pasted the detailed question with inputs and outputs on the doc.
This is your best luck. Just solve it as if you were solving a leetcode question.

Type 2: Throwing you a story and expect you to ask more.
For example, a story could be like "A company follows certain hierachy. There are employees with different levels. A higher level can send message to a lower level. How much time is needed for all employees to receive the message from the top manager?" You need to translate the problem to "finding the maximum depth of the N-ary tree from root to leaf" and solve it.

Type 3: Mention the problems verbally without typing anything
This happen more than 50% of my interviews. You must type the requirements or story to prevent forgetting any, and go on with clarification questions and approaches.

2. Clarification on Inputs, Outputs and Data formats

Often we implicitly assumed the inputs, outputs and other data formats. However, interviewers expect you to mention them clearly. Using the "1057. Campus Bikes" question as an example, the question asked in actual interview could be as simple as "Can you design an algorithm that matches every bike and person such that each individual distance is minimized?" You need to ask the following questions.

How are the bikes and people represented? Are they lists, tuples or graphs (e.g. 2D matrix)?
How are locations represented? Are they coordinates, latitude and longitude, or something else?
How is the data coming from? Are they in main memory? file? or streaming data? (need different DS/approach to handle each of them)
Are they sorted? Any range of locations? Are they floating points or integers?
Your goal is to get as much information as possible such that the final question looks like a solvable leetcode question.

3. Prepare elementary math concepts

Sometimes some elementary math comes into play. You may need them in certain questions. The examples are but not limited to:

Geometry (Slope, Areas, Perimeters, Vectors, Matrices, Orthogonality)
Characters Encoding (ASCII, bit representations)
Common distance formula (L1 norm, L2 norm)
Distributions (Uniform Distribution, Random Sampling)
4. Be ready to discuss scalability/distributed system-related quetions

If you are very good to be reaching this stage, you will probably need these mindsets to further increase your chance of passing.

Common questions regarding these topics are:

What if now I have a very very large input and I need to run the algorithm many many times? How do you optimize it?
I made an example for 973. K Closest Points to Origins
(https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/discuss/576025/python-3-lines-knn-search-using-kd-tree-for-large-number-of-queries)
What if I have a lot of computers as resources? How would you optimize the algorithm given such resources?
Some strategies to address the above questions are but not limited to:

Time-space trade off (Use alternative DS such that more memory is taken but less time cost for each run)
Pre-processing tactics (A higher time complexity for pre-processing is fine as you only need to pre-process once, but then later on have much better time cost for each run)
Concurrency optimization (Map Reduce, Multi-threads, etc)
Feeling
A bit of a bummer knowing that I have failed. One failure has higher opportunity cost for me (and other Hong Kong students) as there are not much SWE posts available. However, I think I am on the right track. I just need more time to solve more questions with speed and accuracy, which is a time game.


### GOogle and amazon
<a href="https://leetcode.com/discuss/compensation/544859/google-l4-amazon-l5-seattle-jan-2020" target="_blank">https://leetcode.com/discuss/compensation/544859/google-l4-amazon-l5-seattle-jan-2020</a>
Overview
I was luckily contacted by two sources from both Google and Amazon in October of 2019. I ended up getting offers from both companies.

Experience
4 Years of Experience (Another top tech company)
BS Computer Engineering

Preperation
Non-LeetCode

I read the entire Cracking the Coding Interview and looked over the solutions to every problem.
Memorized and watched all design questions on HackerRank Youtube Channel which is produced by the same author as cracking the coding interview. Specifically, memorize Hashtable, DFS, BFS, Binary Search, MergeSort, BubbleSort, Linked List ... basically everything.
Watched some videos from ClÃ©ment Mihailescu but directed more towards College Students.
Videos from TechLead
System design videos all over youtube
Example coding interviews on youtube (but most of them were on the easier side and really just as analysis of what kinds of follow up questions to do and how to talk through problems)
LeetCode
I purchased premium (do it) and looked over/solved all the questions common to both Amazon and Google. Other problems I did I sorted by frequency. If I found a problem that I could come up with the answer to in a minute, I skipped it and went to the next problem.
11 Easy, 18 Medium, 7 Hard (like 60+ almost-solved, didn't waste time with small bugs)
4 practice interviews

Interviews

Google
Onsite:

Given nodes, tell if they connect Quora
Snapshot Array
Binary Search Question Something Like this but a little more complex
Design a rubiks cube (open ended)
Behavioral (How do you prioritize, when did you lead something, etc.)
Amazon
Online Screen:

Number of Islands
Something like Find all anagrams in a string
Onsite:

Given edges, create a tree and validate (Similar: Graph Valid Tree)
Behavioral (But every interview had 30 minutes of behavioral)
Design Question: Design subscribe and save
Is linked list a palindrome, solve O(n) constant memory (Palindrome Linked List)
Design a command line system (looking for use of interfaces, inheritence, extensibility)
Offers

Google
Salary: 150K
Sign-on: 30K
Stocks: 300K
Bonus: 15% Salary (24K)
TC ~280K

Amazon
Salary: 150K
Sign-on: 120K first year, 80K second year
Stock: 180K (5%->15%->40%->40%)
TC ~280K

Was very happy with the process and ended up picking Google for benefits reasons (401K match is greater, free food, etc) and had other co-workers around the team I would be working on.

Hopefully some of this insight helps and helps others negotiate and land a job at one of these tech companies :)


### Google and amazon

<a href="https://leetcode.com/discuss/compensation/544859/google-l4-amazon-l5-seattle-jan-2020" target="_blank">https://leetcode.com/discuss/compensation/544859/google-l4-amazon-l5-seattle-jan-2020</a>

Status: Entry Level Software Engineer at a public company, BS in CS at an unknown university in the U.S.
Position: Level 3 Software Engineer at Google and Level 4 at Amazon (both entry level)
Location: Mountain View, CA for Google and Seattle, WA for Amazon
Date: Feb 25th for Google and March 2nd for Amazon

How I got my resume picked up and got an interview?
I graduated in 2018 from college and applied to 40+ companies, including Google. All applications were done online. Luckily, a Technical Sourcer from Google sent me an email the same day (This almost never happens, please do not apply online, I'll tell you how else to do it).

However, my current company made me an exciting offer even before I scheduled my technical phone screen with Google, and they gave me 72 hours to make a decision. I had no choice but to take the offer and email the Sourcer at Google, telling her that I'm gonna have to bail on the Google opportunity.

I kept her on my contact list and contacted her in January of this year, asking if there's any openings.

And for Amazon, I got an employee referral.

Advice on how to get an interview
Do not apply online, talk to a recruiter directly or ask for an employee referral. Don't know anyone working at FAANG? Me neither! What did I do to get a referral from Amazon? I have been adding a few people on LinkedIn everyday since graduation! I now have close to 2,000 connections. Every time I want to apply for a job, I have like 8 - 15 connections who work at that company. I simply message all of them to kindly ask for a referral. Do the same!!!

Technical phone screen with Google (45 mins):
Conducted on Jan 29th. Very standard string manipulation question, easy/medium on LeetCode. A related question that I can think of would be https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/. Everything went smoothly, I knew I was going to get an onsite interview after this one.

Got a response from my recruiter on Feb 4th, telling me that they were moving forward to an onsite.

Technical phone screen with Amazon (1 hour):
Conducted on Feb 10th. First 15 mins were all behavioral questions. Simply google "Top Amazon Behavioral Questions" and prepare for like 25 of them. It is much easier to prepare for BQ than for algorithm or system design questions.

Next 20 mins was a system design question. I had NEVER prepared for system design questions and I didn't know how to answer a system design question. I won't share too much with you about this, because I knew I messed up the second he asked me that question. I still got an onsite interview probably for 2 reasons: First, I'm just entry level, second, I did well in the algorithm question.

Next 20 mins was an algorithm question. Medium level question, a related question on LeetCode would be https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/.

Got a response from my recruiter on Feb 12th, telling me that they were moving forward to an onsite.

Onsite Interview with Google
Conducted on Feb 25th at Google Mountain View. 10 AM - 3 PM.

10:00 - 10:45. A fairly simple BFS question. A related LeetCode question would be https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/. Didn't need a hint, performed well.
10:45 - 11:30. Medium level question. Cannot find any related questions on LeetCode, but it involved recursion memoization and string manipulation. Didn't need a hint solving the question itself, but doing Time/Space complexity analysis was a bit tricky for me, I had to get a hint. But overall, performed well.
11:30 - 12:15. Medium level question, involves sorting. Related questions on LeetCode would be https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii/. Didn't perform well at all. Interviewer was late due to a metting, she got there almost 10 mins late. The worst part is, I knew how to do it, because I had seen similar questions on LeetCode. However, the interviewer didn't seem to understand what I was talking about. I didn't even ask for a hint, but she gave me one, implying that I should do it her way, instead of my way. I know I probably should've listened to her, but I already had a solution in mind, and by the time she gave me that hint, we only had about 20 mins left. I did it my way in the end anyway and she was completely silent in the last 5 mins or so. I felt horrible after this round.
12:15 - 13:15. Lunch interview.
13:15 - 14:00. Hard level question. Related question on LeetCode would be https://leetcode.com/problems/student-attendance-record-ii/. I proposed a brute force solution, even that solution took me about 20 mins to think & write. Was asked to optimize, had to take two hints before I could solve it. Felt OK considering I did have both brute force solution & an optimized solution.
14:15 - 15:00. Behavioral Questions. Nobody could tell whether they performed well in this one, but I felt I did OK, at least if I ever get rejected, it wouldn't be because of this one.
Timeline after the onsite interview with Google:

Feb 25th: The onsite interview
Feb 27th: Recruiter started collecting feedback from interviewers
Mar 5th: All feedback collected, recruiter decided to present my candidacy to the Hiring Committee (HC). When I asked him if he thinks I'd have a good chance of passing the HC, his exact words were "I'm very hopeful" (that made me feel sad because I thought that meant I was a borderline candidate).
Mar 5th: Also on the same day, I started my team matching process.
Mar 6th: Approval from HC. However, I got downleveled to L3 from L4 because one of the interviewers expressed his/her concern regarding my level. He/She thinks that I should be a level 3 engineer, not level 4. I'm gonna assume it was the third interviewer who provided this feedback, because that was the only interview that I horribly messed up.
Mar 12th: Team match successful.
Mar 13th: Official Offer Letter received. Did not negotiate further, because I had a competing offer from Amazon, and my recruiter at Google had already given the information to the compensation team, and the team adjusted the compensation to match Amazon's + a bit more.
Mar 14th: Accepted official offer letter and started background check process.
Mar 17th: Background check completed, all set for my first day on April 06th.
Onsite Interview with Amazon:
Conducted on Mar 2nd. Switched to a virtual onsite interview due to Coronavirus. 9 AM - 2 PM.

First 25 - 30 mins of every single round involves behavioral questions, I'll just provide info on the second half of the interviews.

9:00 - 10:00. With a manager on the team. Asked a system design question, again, bombed it, but I didn't feel awful at all for some reason. I guess, subconciously, I didn't think system design question for an entry level developer really matter that much.
10:00 - 11:00. Medium Level, pattern matching. Related question on LeetCode https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/. Follow-up question involves KMP algorithm. No hint needed, performed well.
11:00 - 12:00. Medium level, DFS/Topological sort. Related question on LeetCode https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/. No hint needed, performed well.
12:00 - 13:00. Lunch break, would've been a lunch interview if it weren't because of this virus, I had so many questions.
13:00 - 14:00. 2 related questions, first Medium level BFS. Related question on LeetCode https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/. Follow-up question was a bit harder, related question on LeetCode https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder-ii/. NOTE, I didn't have to finish the follow-up question, he simply asked me what ideas I had in my head. After all, there was only 30 mins for the coding part. No hint needed, performed well.
Timeline after the "onsite" interview with Amazon:

Mar 3rd: less than 24 hours after my interview, my recruiter called me and told me they intend on making me an offer.
Mar 5th: Official offer received.
Mar 9th: Had already gotten approved by HC at Google, so negotiated with Amazon to get a better offer.
Mar 11th: Approved, updated official offer letter received.
Mar 17th: Declined offer.
Google Offer: $210K first year total compensation.
Amazon Offer: $176K first year total compensation.
2 offers are very similar if you factor in the state tax & cost of living.

Please ask any questions you may have, I'll be sure to answer all of your questions.

UPDATE 1
Got asked this question by a few people, so I'll just answer it here: How did I prepare for the interviews and how long did it take?
I don't have any "smart" strategy, but this is what I did in preparation for the interviews.
I started 8 months prior to applying, but most of the work was done during the last 3 months.

I solved all easy + medium questions and 60+ hard questions, that sums up to 700+ questions on LeetCode. I also skipped all questions that have a lot more "dislikes" than "likes", because I think they're mostly brain teasers, not practical at all.

I also finished Crack The Coding Interview. I should've finished this book first before I did LeetCode, because I wasted a lot of time googling "recursion with memoization", "dynamic programming", etc., while all of them were very well explained in that book.

I did not use any other coding platform or book to prepare for my interview. I did not join any contest on LeetCode. I did not do competitive programming. But again, don't take me as an example, because I'm just an entry level developer. If you're aiming for Level 5 or above, you'd probably have to do a lot more.

UPDATE 2
Asked in the comment section, full timeline, from the point I talked to a recruiter to the point I receive an offer

GOOGLE:

Jan 8th. Emailed a recruiter at Google (she's been on my contact list for a year). In the email, I included some basic information about myself, e.g., My skillset, what positions I'm interested in at Google, what project I'm working on, is there a good time to have a phone call with you? etc.
Jan 8th. On the same day, several hours after my email, the recruiter replied and told me "Let's chat!".
Jan 9th. At 2 PM, initial recruiter screen. We talked about my experience and skillset. The phone call lasted 20 mins. I let her know I am all ready to do technical phone screen with a Google engineer.
Jan 9th. I emailed her after the phone call to give her a list of my availablity.
Jan 16th. I received an email from an Software Engineer at Google, he asked me to confirm the date and time of the phone screen, which would be on Jan 29th. I gladly accepted the invitation for interview.
Jan 29th. The phone screen.
Feb 4th. Got an email from the recruiter. She asked me "Do you have time today to chat?" I was extremely nervous when I saw that.
Feb 4th. Later that day, I had a call with the recruiter. She told me we were moving to onsite (God bless her!). Didn't talk about when to have the onsite interview during the phone call. All I told was to give her a list of availability for onsite and then wait.
Feb 12th. Got an email from another recruiter, to confirm my onsite interview on Feb 25th.
Whatever happened after that has already been included in the original post.
A little over 2 months for the entire process.

AMAZON:

Jan 20th. Started messaging every LinkedIn connection who work at Amazon to kindly ask for a referral.
Jan 30th. A Software Engineer replied and submitted the referral.
Jan 30th. A few hours later, a recruiter at Amazon emailed me "Hi XXX. Thank you for your interest in the position. I would love to set up a time to speak with you ....".
Jan 30th. Phone call with the recruiter. (Yes, all of the 3 steps above took place on the same day!!!!!!!!!!). Since I was already ready for the interview, I also told him I'd like to interview with Amazon ASAP, and I'm available every day.
Feb 3rd. Initial phone screen scheduled for Feb 10th.
Feb 10th. The phone screen.
Feb 12th. Received an email from the recruiter, saying that we are moving forward to onsite. I told him I'd be available everyday for the onsite.
Feb 14th. Received an email from another recruiter at Amazon, confirming my availability for the onsite for Mar 2nd.
Whatever happened after that has already been included in the original post.
A little less than 2 months for the entire process.

UPDATE 3
How did I practice LeetCode?
Disclaimer: I'm not an expert on algorithm questions, I'm just a lucky guy who happened to pass the interviews. If you ask me to do it again, I wouldn't be 100% confident that I can pass again.

When I couldn't solve a problem, I did the following things, at each step, I went back to the question and thought about it a little longer:

Expand "Topic". I use this as a hint, for example, when the question is tagged "binary search", I try to apply binary search algorithm.
Expand "Hint".
Go to "Discussion" but don't open any posts. Usually people title their posts with "Java Implementation using Binary Search", etc., so I know I should use binary search to solve the problem.
After the first 3 steps, if I still couldn't figure out, I look at the solutions.
Every time I encounter a topic that I had never seen before, I went straight to the solution or watch YouTube videos on this topic. For example, the very first Hard question I did was https://leetcode.com/problems/critical-connections-in-a-network/, which made use of Tarjan's Algorithm. After the hint, I went to YouTube to learn this algorithm first because I had never even heard of it before. Then I came back and looked at the solution.

I did all questions 3 times. Skipped a lot of them when reviewing because they became very easy, even some of the medium level questions.

I struggled a lot at first, meaning I had to frequently check the discussion/solution. It was extremely discouraging, but remember, nobody was born being good at algorithms, don't give up.

### Facebook
Hi everyone,
I have learnt a lot from the leetcode community and would like to share my experience for all you hardworkers out there!

Status: New grad, BA - top 50 CS school, International student in a top Canadian University
Position: New Grad / SDE1 at Amazon

Final round interviews (3) scheduled - 29th January
Waitlist email - 3rd February
Offer - 11th March

OA questions

Merge two sorted lists
Symmetric tree
Passed all test cases for both.
Other assessments went fine too.

Final Round Interviews:
I should probably mention that I had gone back home after college ended for me in December and so there was a time difference of 12 hours. So I basically had to interview from 2am to 5am.

Round 1
LP: Very general questions

Tell me about yourself, Past work experience
Who is a good leader according to you? Tell me about a time when you exhibited great leadership
Why Amazon? What do you want to achieve from working here?
How do you keep yourself updated in the field of technology
TECHNICAL: Custom Question - What data structure would be able to depict a very basic social media network. I answered (graph) and then he was like okay design the classes and everything. So I asked a couple of questions and he seemed to want a very basic graph with just the person name and a list of his friends as attributes. Thereafter, he asked me to make a recommendation system wherein given a person, the algo should output the list of friends he should be recommended. I asked him questions here too and worked out a simple BFS solution. Then, I talked about edge cases, however, I missed an important one which he pointed out and so I quickly introduced a set to resolve the issue. For some reason, he thought that my code was wrong initially and confronted me about it but I rechecked and told him that it is indeed correct. He looked again and then realised his mistake. This took away some time though. Thereafer, he asked me to modify the code so as to only a specified number of recommendations are shown. I said the algo verbally and quickly modified my code for it. I missed out on telling one little thing because of time (that a heap will be used to filter out) which I felt bad about later since it seems trivial. However, the interviewer seemed very happy and I was sure that my interviews had kicked off well.

Round 2
LP: Specifics from my previous experience - what did I do in this role etc. Turned out the work i did during my internship and his first gig ever were very similar so we bonded well over the talks from it. He just basically dived deep into this one experience I had had and kept asking me questions to test both my technical knowledge pertaining to it and my behavior to some circumstances while I worked there.

TECHNICAL: Strange Question - Given a list of words, print all words which has components (words too) of itself in the list. For example - and input of [rockstar, rocks, stars, rock, super, high, way, highways, superhigh] would yield output - superhigh = super + high. and nothing else. I was stumped at first but I quickly arrived at a brute force n^3 solution. Thereafter, I got lost quite a few times but kept talking. My interviewer gave me a lot of hints and a lot of direction for this question I think and in the end I wrote a good piece of code for it and he was happy. I felt that if I get a rejection, it would probably be because of this interview since it felt as if I didn't arrive at the optimal soution myself.
EDIT: Question Concatenated Words

Round 3
LP: Very general questions again

Tell me about yourself
A team experience where you contributed a lot
An experience you found the most fruitful and why
TECHNICAL: Reorder Linkedlist - this one I got lucky cause I had solved this before. However, I kind of blanked out for a couple minutes when I saw the question. But then I thought for a few minutres and arrived at the solution and after discussing the optimal approach, started coding it. However, at this point I was extremely tired and couldn't think straight it was 4am. I think that kind of made me lose my thoughts and I wavered a few times and was generally way slower than I would be considering I knew the algo. Towards the end of the interview time, I did a silly mistake in one area which I pointed out but was too late to correct it. The interviewers (one was shadowing I believe) seemed very happy though so I felt as if I did finee on this one too.

I got my offer a month and a half after my interview - I am grateful about it nevermind the long frustrating wait.

Some background, some advice
I wanted to mention that this has come after a very tough year for me. I interned at a tier 2 company in summer 2018 and felt confident (perhaps overconfident) that I'll be able to score tier 1 internships next summer. And that confidence was crushed, shattered countless number of times the entire 2018-2019 year because the rejections flowed through my inbox on a daily basis. It was particularly devastating since I had set some expectations for myself and I was failing miserably at attaining these to say the least. I was not even getting jobs I wouldn't want at all. I started blaming myself - started stressing and doubting my abilities.

I worked a regular job that my college offered during the summer of 2019 since I was refused everywhere I sought employment. All summer was spent stressing and preparing for the next season - the full time application season. The season started very rocky actually so I was again quite low for a while actually - I must point that out. It wasn't like I worked really hard for a summer and everything fell in place. Not at all. The process was gruelling and long. I started to get so stressed that before my Microsoft and Google final Interviews, I got too sick - it was as if my body had started to exhibit this heightened stress and I felt helpless

Anyway, my point was that

There were highs and lows, and I'm sure you have those too. But we must go easy on ourselves.
System is not fair, Life is not fair. A reality that is just unfair in itself.
Compensation is important but only till a point - relationships / close people are way more important than that. They are the ones that make you stay sane during the hard times. So don't let the hard times take away the only thing that makes you stronger.
If you ask me what I loved the most about 2019, I would say, without a doubt, the times my girlfriend "forced" me out to enjoy the beautiful summer. And I remember I used fight with her that I want to prep lol. Literally, the entire time spent on leetcode is one hazy memory, but the times spent together with her are vivid in my head and still don't fail to bring a smile to my face. You might say now that I have an offer I am saying all this, but to be brutally honest, this was my answer even like 6 months ago. I don't remember how I came to realise it but I'm so glad I did realise it.

Resources
I think I must have done around 200 LC questions in total. I used premium and I definitely think it's helpful - would recommend. I used groking the DP interview too cause I just always struggled with DP. It was useful too. I did 75% of the CTCI too (mostly in the summer). For Amazon, in particular, I didnt do much for the LPs - just memorized what they were and thought of them on the spot when a question was asked.


### Facebook, E4
My turn to give it back to the community.

Question 0. Similar strings ("face", "eacf") returns true if only 2 positions in the strings are swapped. Here 'f' and 'e' are swapped in the example.
Question 1. Number Of connected components in a Graph,
Question 2 (Behavior interview/ coding). Is there a way to reach (0,0) from a mXn matrix to (m-1,n-1) position and give the path.
Question 3 System Design : Design a Content publishing site with privacy restrictions.
Questions 4. https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/
Question 5. n-ary Tree with each node having a boolean flag. Traverse all the nodes with only boolean flag = True. Return the total distance traveled from root to all those nodes.


### Facebook, Research Scientist
Status: New grad, PhD CS
Position: Research Scientist at Facebook
Location: Seattle, WA
Date: December 9th, 2019

I was contacted by a recruiter from Facebook when I haven't even started looking and preparing. But I went with it anyway since I had 8 months until graduation and this would be a great experience. This was my first ever interview and it was a stressful one as well since I only had a month to prepare.

Technical phone screen (45 minutes):
Two technical questions:

The first one I don't actually remember but it was pretty easy and straighforward. It took about 15 minutes to finish both explaining and writing.
The second one was also straightforward but it was a little bit tricky and had a lot of edge cases. He asked me to implement an API class to be a middle man between another API which provided files in 1024 bytes only and users. However, users could ask for any amount of bytes from our API. This class should have a buffer to store all the recieving data and passes it to users. There was just a lot of cases, e.g. what if the user asks for a data size bigger than what it is left, what if the file was too large, and few more.
Onsite:
I had my onsite on Monday and started around 10AM. The interviewer arrived few minutes late but we still had time since the actual interviews started at 10:15AM. I had 2 technical interview (had 3 but last one got cancelled) and 1 research interview.
In the 2 interviews I finished answering all 4 questions. I don't remember the order but here are 3 of them:

Validate BST: This one I suggested a recursive implmentation and he asked me to go ahead and implement it. I ended up with 2 functions but at the end I suggested that we could do it with 1 function as well.
Sort alien dictionary: The question was given a list of words and string which gives the order of alphabet, sort the words. e.g. "bac" means b comes before a and a comes before c. I think I used hashtable to store the orders and then went ahead and implemented it with a regular sort using the hashtable. I think this was the one I messed in implementation in few places. I just had hiccups since it was the last question and I was very tired.
Sum of consecutive element in array: Similar to this, however, the integers where non-negative. GIven an unordered list of non negative integers, find the range where the sum of range was equal to target. First I suggested a bruteforce method. He asked if I can improve it. I thought about it out loud for 2 minutes ish! And came up with an O(n) solution using two pointers. He asked me to go ahead and implement it and the implementation was pretty quick. Once you figure out the optimal solution it was easy to implement.
(Unfortunately I don't remember the last, which was the easiest)
My research interview was nothing interesting, it was basically about my PhD research and asked questions about my approach in solving research problems.

They told me it should take about two weeks to get back. Exactly after two weeks, on Monday, I got email that they went ahead with someone else. I asked for the reason of rejection and they told me they can't give me any details but I should try again in a year.

Takeaway from this interview: I think I came up with solutions pretty fast, however, I was a little rusty in implementations. Since then I have been practicing a lot more and hopefully, soon will join all the 9 to 5ers. Until then happy coding!

All the best to all who have upcoming interviews.! Hope this helps!

UPDATE: I forgot that I had a design interview as well. The question was to design a website for Programming Contests. I had experiment in ACM competitions so I did come up with a solution and designed a full system with APIs and Databases.

The second one was also straightforward but it was a little bit tricky and had a lot of edge cases. He asked me to implement an API class to be a middle man between another API which provided files in 1024 bytes only and users. However, users could ask for any amount of bytes from our API. This class should have a buffer to store all the receiving data and passes it to users. There were just a lot of cases, e.g. what if the user asks for a data size bigger than what it is left, what if the file was too large, and a few more.

Can anybody please tell me the answer to this question?

Also interviews are not only solving problems, it's also about showing that you understand the problem, your solution, what corner cases to cover, how to test and how to discuss it with others

### Amazon
Status: 3 YOE
Position: SDE 2 at a 2nd Tier Tech Company
Location: Boston, MA
Date: Feb, 2020

I've read many interview experiences on this site, it's lead to effectively preparing for my interviews so it's my turn to give back.

Premise
I've been seeing a girl since college (6 years relationship) and after graduation, we ended up getting different jobs on both sides of the country. She worked at MSFT in Redmond while I was in Boston. After 1 year of long distance, I decided to leave my current company and move in with my GF. We planned this decision a long time ago but I didn't start really practicing until October 2019. So that gives me about 4 months of practice. I started slow day one but ended up doing about 3-4 hours a day on a work day and 8-10 hours each day on the weekend with lots of breaks in between. The month December and January is where I went really hard and I had most of my interviews in Feb. The investment was real, I figured I had a single opportunity to improve my quality of life so why not give it my all. Over the course of studying, I found the practice in coding and system to be very helpful to my day job where it lead to success in design discussions. I set up 7 onsites with Amazon, Google, MSFT (3 teams), Zillow, Redfin over three weeks of interviews.

Tools that helped me succeed:

Leetcode premium - worth it, I started slow at first but ended up completing 47/128/49 easy/med/hard problems in 4 months.
Grooking the system design interview - this was what passed my system design at amazon.
Youtube - I watched several mock system design interviews to get a sense of what it was asked and this was incredibly helpful.
System Design Primer (donnemartin) - good system design finger food
DanCroitor - the best LP preperation you could do
Questions to ask after your interview - this makes you seem smart and care about the work to build additional trust with your interviewer
The Entry
A recruiter found me on LinkedIn so I chatted with him over the phone. He asked me about my work experience and two LP questions "what-if questions". They weren't really technical and I answered generally. He scheduled me for an OA.

OA
Standard two hour online assessment, two questions and self evaluation.

https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/411357/ all test cases passed
https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/460127/ (Top N Competitors/Buzzwords â­â­â­ [Experienced]) 19/21 test cases. When I reflect why it was not fully passed, I forgot to consider the case where a popular toy's name has an apostrophe or a special character in it like ["popeye's", "beyblade!"]. I used a brute regex in java (\W+) to tokenize the string.
The recruiter contacted me right after saying I did well and scheduled me for a onsite for 3 weeks later.

On site
I had a very enjoyable time interviewing with Amazon. They respected me and allowed me to take breaks in between. They flew me into Seattle and put me in a nearby hotel. I woke up at 7am that morning, naturally because of EST time, had a good breakfast and went to the office for interviews from 8:30 to 12:30. I was extermely nervous, palms sweaty, and in the back of my mind I had a sense of pressure that I could not f@ck this up and everything was on the line (in fact the pressure helped me succeed in a way, more on this later). I tried to talk to another dude that came to interview to try to drown out my stress, which it helped. As soon as I started my interviews, I think I just let my personality do the talking. As a reflection, the interviewers have two phases, LP and technical. If the interviewer asks the coding question first, I found a positive correlation between doing well in coding means the LPs will go smoothly as well.

The first interviewer started off asking LP for 30 minutes. He really dug into my past, I was not prepared to go that deep and I wasn't sure how well I STAR formatted the answer. After thirty minutes, I was given a question was about "given a file of parents and children of humans", write me a function to tell me the parent with the most direct children. This was simple. Follow up was "change your code to return the parent with the most children/grandchildren at n generations away". My initial verbal answer was DFS which was wrong (nervous), but when I started to code, I realized it was a BFS and I've done a ton of those on leetcode. Similar to https://leetcode.com/problems/all-nodes-distance-k-in-binary-tree/
The second interviewer was the bar raiser. He started off with the system design question: build uber. Now there are example of this on Youtube (search designing uber) and Grooking the SS interview that I read so I was fairly prepared. Being hit with this question in reality was not the same as the books, no constrains were given, no requirements given, you must ask everything. I started off with the functional and non functional requirements. I drew a very high level design of app, servers, and database on the board and then I went into thinking about the use cases. I asked my interviewer what use case should I design first, he said the driver discovery feature, so I ended up drawing a sequence diagram on what services this feature migh touch. Broken up into application servers, search servers, quad tree servers, notification servers, and several others like google maps services. He asked several other follow up questions which I then added to my sequence diagram which now spanned the entire white board. He challenged me on how I would attain my non-functional requirements (speed, consistency, etc) and I replied with all the knowledge I got from the Grooking SS course. After the system design was over, I felt really good about it and we went into LP. He asked what I have invented at my previous job (plenty as we are a medium sized company), when have I ever exceeded my expectations. I worked on a generally impact piece of the business so his questions were easy for me to answer. I know not everyone reading this will have the benefit of leaving an impactful position. My advice is to critically think how you can tell your story to make it sound impressive. Say "I" more than "we", explain what tools and tech you used in detail, and give quantitative results (I cut down algo time by 10% etc).
The third interviwer asked me a coding question first. The requestion related to sumarizing statistic from a log file. I had to do some simple maths here. The interviewer was very helpful and would confirm my answers immediately which gave me confidence (unlike my other interviews at other companies). When I was done, the follow up question was how to extend the log parser if we wanted to make it extensible to keep track of more fields. I tought the Visitor pattern would make sense here, each log line is visted by multiple stat collectors that only take what the collector should keep track off. The interviewer was impression with this application of the design pattern, and the LP questions went really smoothly. The LPs question had asked when I have taken initiative to design something.
The last interview was with two folks, I think there was one person shadowing. At this point my brain was pretty fried from all the talking so I was on cruise control. We started out with LP, we went into a little bit about a time when I made a decision and committed to it. I talked about my previous projects and drew some architecture diagrams on the board. The coding question was implement an LRU with a product usecase. I think it was a spotify music playlist. I got it done in 10 minutes using a LinkedHashMap. Then the interviewer challenged me to implement my own LRU, with my own static node class and pointere management. I had to be very careful when implementing a doubly linked list when changing the pointers around. As I was coding I spoke everything out loud because my brain wasn't working, but my mouth was. If I made a mistake and it sounded wrong, either I or the interviewer would react and allowed me to fix it. I finished the implementation with the nick of time left and I was escorted out of the building.
Aftermath
I had lunch near the Amazon campus, took a walk near South Union lake to relax and reflect. Got an email from my recruiter 3 hours after the interview with an invitation to talk the following Monday. Since I did my interview on a Friday, this was really fast turn around. I stressed over the weekend and got a call on Monday telling me that I will be getting an offer. I was really estatic... so happy that I bombed my next interview at Google, knowing that I secured my place already for the move. Don't be me, stay focused! Hold your emotions in when you get an offer or else your brain will not be incentivized to work hard. My initial offer was high, but not the number that I asked for: 260k TC. The recruiter and I shared feedback and I told him that I'll be pursuing onsites at multiple places. It was approximately two weeks until I would get my next offer at MSFT. Due to burn out and competition, I canceled my Redfin, Zillow, and one of the MSFT interviews. Interviewing back to back days proved to be difficult for me in a variety of ways, something I would never do again.

At last, it was a MSFT vs an Amazon offer. I spent 10 days negotiating back and forth with the amazon recruiter. I tried to be as nice as I can to my recruiter, complementing him on preparing me for success (because the recruiters will reach out to you before the interview and give you a study sheet) and replying to his offers with respect. Used words like "the offer is really nice, but I was hoping we can do more..." and "I really appreciate what you put together for me but I have to commit to my other interviews...". Eventually, on the last day of offer expiration, I choose Amazon because the sign on bonus was high and that money is paid out to you in the first two years that don't need to vest. I think this was a right choice as we see what's happening in the market these days. Yes, Amazon bonuses are almost non-existent (expecially for the first 18 months) and benefits are not great, but I'll probably marry a MSFT employee and jump on her insurance plan, I would advise the same for anyone who joins Amazon.

The offer: https://leetcode.com/discuss/compensation/535277/Amazon-or-SDE-2-or-Seattle

Wish everyone best of luck interviewing!

### Google
Sorry this post is going to be long :)
Leetcode has always been a huge help to me. My daily routine has been opening the discussion tab and reading others experiences of which so ever company they applied into, I felt like even I had to contribute into this community. I didnât go anonymous this time :P

YOE: 0 (Pursuing last semester)

I was contacted by google recruiter on 29th November 2019. I did not expect any response back. Mainly cause this has been the case in all the other companies I applied into-Microsoft, Apple, Facebook etc. Being Google my dream company, getting a response itself was a huge thing to me. They asked if I was available for a phone interview in the coming week which I wasnât able to as I was in the process of having my semester end exams. Scheduled the interview just after my exams ended that was on 18th December 2019.

Phone Screen:
I was asked one major question and then follow ups on the basis of the question. The question in layman terms was that we were given a long string like âEvery breathe you take, every move you makeâ and another word-âboomâ, we need to find the shortest string where each letter of the word 'boom' is present in one word of a string at a time i.e the output here will be: âbreathe you take, every move you makeâ and print it. I did this via sliding window with O(n) complexity and space. After that there were couple of follow ups which I was able to answer.

I was contacted by my recruiter the very next day and was told that I have been selected to go for onsites. I was extremely happy on hearing that I didnât have another phone screen. Since we were approaching the holidays I was told that my interviews will be happening in January. When my recruiter contacted my again, I told her that I wanted some time to prepare as whatever be the result I just didnât want any regrets on my side that I was underprepared. Thankfully my recruiter understood that and I was able to schedule my onsites for 12 February 2020.

Onsites:
Round 1: Technical
The interviewer that came in had a 8 YOE. The question he asked me was that we are given a dictionary where every animal has a start and end year at time they existed. Given a year list out all the animals that exists in that time. This was the general question and then we had follow ups. I donât remember everything but it was on the lines of intervals problem and I solved it via Binary search.

Round 2: Technical
The next interview I had was over hangouts. The interviewer asked me a BFS and DFS question. The question was that there was a grid given with each number being the height of a place where you are standing. You can move ahead to the next place only if the difference between the point where you are standing and the next is more that the threshold given. Find whether you can reach there or not. I was able to tell both BFS and DFS+backtracking question. I coded up the BFS solution. We had discussion for follow ups but I was unable to code the follow up.

Round 3: Googlyness and Leadership
This was the Googlyness and Leadership round. It went well but that depends from person to person :)

Round 4: Tecnical
The question asked here unfortunately I donât remember that well. I was able to solve it quickly and was able to micro-optimise it the best. The question was on basis of heaps and arrays. Even though it was my best interview I canât recall the question well. Sorry about that.

Round 5: Tecnical
If the previous round was my best round, this round was my exact opposite round. The question asked was given digits 1-9 with each digit associated with a value. Now we have a wall that needs to be painted with those digits and each digit painted requires the value volume, you need to form the largest number possible from this. Given that the sum of the volume of the number is equal to the wall volume.

Input:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
1 3 1 5 6 7 2 5 2
```
wall volume: 5
Output: 33333

I gave a solution with backtracking but it took the complexity of O(n!). I gave one with DP as well on the lines of coin change with complexity of O(n^2) in time and space as well. But was unable to optimise it further. After discussions for 35 minutes, I was unable to come up with a better solution. Ultimately the interviewer changed the question to a BFS question, which I was able to code up in 5 minutes. After that the interview ended. I was crushed by the last round knowing that if I had a rejection itâll be mainly because of this round.

I didnât hear back from my recruiter for a month until just few days back letting me know that I was rejected. Even though at the back of my head I knew this was going to happen but still it crushed me. I was told that my interviews had no major red flags and I am strong with my coding skills and my code quality is good as well. But I take time to code as well I require hints. My googlyness round recommended me as a strong hire as well as Round 1 and 4 too. In Round 2, I messed up my time complexity analysis which was the reason for my average rating in that. Round 5, I knew I screwed up as well as I was told my DP skills are weak. Being a borderline case, I was told to appear again in a year :)

After preparing my heart and soul for this interview for almost three months, Am I sad?-yes, absolutely. But even when the rejection came, I didnât feel any regret mainly because I did whatever the best I could do. I studied loads on Leetcode, pretty visible from the amount of questions I did. I covered so many new topics I never did before. So Iâm pretty sure I am not the same coder as I was four months ago. To everyone who appeared, or is in the process I just want to say that:

Never compare yourself to another person-be it over here or anywhere. If that person has done 80 questions or 800 it doesnât matter to you. Just be yourself and do your own preparations.
Rather than doing 100 questions of one type, do one question of 100 types. Itâs better to do more in quality than in quantity.
If you need more time, just ask the recruiter. They are on your team and will try there best to help you-So be thankful to them.
Interview process is long and tedious. The onsites feel pretty long so just be calm and work through the day. I felt that my interviews went great cause I took all of them more like a discussion rather than an interview itself.
Donât take interviews as a Do-or-die situation. It is not the end of the world and panicking will never lead you anywhere. Being nervous is alright but donât let that nervousness hinder your interviews. The interviewers are there to help you and they want you to suceed as well.
Get your feedback straight. Know your weak points so that if you appear again or try somewhere else, these points are not the reason for you to fail.
Rejection always hurts but I feel like this rejection is what motivates me to do better. I failed but I learnt so much more that I donât see it as a negative experience. Maybe one day I will get into Google and then I will remember that I did struggle a lot but that is what makes me what I am today :)
Luck factor will always come into play and interviews are a gamble of luck. You can just try the best you can as to never have any regrets.
I went to write this post as a way to let go of my negative thoughts that I started having post rejection. After four months of preparations it does hurt but there's nothing I can do about it now. I can only learn more and more and try again.

If you were able to read this long post, thank you so much for reading it. I hope you were able to get something out of it. To anyone appearing for any onsites - All the very best. I hope you clear it :)

P.S: I was told that My DP and Time analysis is weak. If you can tell me any resources worth studying to get them strong. And just not DP, recursion and backtracking as well. Itâll be of great help :)

    - Yes, file descriptors are local to the process. When a process forks a child, however, the parent and child have the same file descriptor table. This is great because it allows for IO redirection, which is a pretty handy trick. - `epoll`ì ë±ë¡ê°ë¥

### Google
#### Google Interview Experience
I think now it's my turn of giving back to the community. I had been recently interviewed at Google, unfortunately couldn't clear it.

Phone Screen:

Problem : Variation of the Course scheduled problem, Given the dependency of the courses, if a course A is prerequisite for course B then course A must be completed in some semester before the semester in which course B is completed, find the minimum no. of semesters required to complete all the courses.

I could solve this problem and then I was invited for the onsite to Google's Hyderabad office. In Hyderabad office, there were five back to back coding rounds and no G & L round.

Round - 1 :

Problem - 1:
You have a machine with one core and you are given start time and end time of the programs, check whether new program can be scheduled or not. You are basically given query describing schedule of the new program i.e, [s, e] s and e are the start and end time of the new program, return true if it can be scheduled, false otherwise.

Follow-up:
Your are given machine with 4 cores (4 programs can run simultaneously) check whether new program can be added or not.

Firstly I gave the brute force solution(O(N)) then I suggested then optimized solution using binary search** O(Log N)**.

Ran out of time for the follow up question, so I could solve this partially.

Round - 2
Problem - 1:
Given an array and an integer K, find the length of longest subarray that has sum less than or equal to K.

First gave O(N2) solution, then gave O(N) solution using sliding window.

Follow-up:
Given a matrix of M * N find the size of the biggest square that has sum less than or equal to K.

First gave brute force solution, then optimzed one using DP.

Problem - 2:
Find the length of longest AP sequence which is there in the tree.

Couldn't solve this one, ran out of time.

Round - 3

Problem - 1:
You are given D units of data that needs to be transferred over the network and packet size K, find minimum no of packets required to transfer all the data.

This was a no brainer, I think this was the warmup problem.

Follow up:
Distribute data in each packet such that difference between data in any two packets should be minimum.

Round - 4:

Given an array of integers that is already sorted based on first 28 bits, solve the array by all the bits.

Couldn't solve this problem

Round - 5:

Problem - 1:

Given a binary locking system, you are also given initial and final state of the lock and all the states that are safe.

From one state you can go to another state by flipping one bit at a time and the new generated state should be same.

You need to check whether you can unlock the given binary lock or not.

Follow Up:
Later he limited the size of safe states to 100 and asked me to optimize.

First I gave the DFS solution, later optimized using DSU. couldn't derive time complexity for this solution.

Lessons Learned

Focus on speed, take the timed contests when you are preparing.
Do not take more than 2-3 minutes to discuss brute force solution.
If you already know the solution, immediately after brute force jump to it, don't waste time in discussing two three alternative approaches.
Many of you may not agree with the third point, but the thing is that when you are interviewing with google, each round last for exactly 45 mins and you are expected to write the complete code.

#### Google 2
I think it's my turn to give back to the wonderful leetcode community. I recently received an offer from Google. Following is my experience.

Journey

I have about 3.5 years of experience working as a Software Engineer. I actively started looking for Job 4 months back wherein I interviewed for Facebook and Google. I got rejected in onsite interviews of Facebook. I have solved around 110 questions on leetcode around 32 Easy 60 Medium and 20 Hard. I have found difficult implementing Hard level leetcode questions (to this date I still do).I didn't want to loose out on any of my options hence I purchased Leetcode premium which was definitely helpful for Facebook's preparation(All the questions I received in my phone screen and onsite were already part of Premium problems)although not that helpful for Google. I tried to solve problems on codeforces and topcoder back during my college days and was on and off with leetcode during past couple of months. In retrospect I should have tried to implement more problems on Leetcode as I have been scared of problems which involve heavy implementation :(

I had already interviewed with Google around 2 years back which went very bad according to the recruiter neverthless I was given one more shot.I thought I would share my Interview experience with Leetcode community below post summarises my Interview experience.

Interview Experience

Phone Screen (45 Minutes)

It was fairly easy question involving priority queue. I had already seen some similar questions hence wasn't difficult for me to come up with approach. The interviewer was happy with the approach and asked me to code it up which I did. Afterwards the interviewer found some syntatical errors in my code which I corrected immediately (nothing logical). I thought I did good.

The recruiter followed up and said the feedback was quite positive and I will move to onsite. She told me that there will be 3 Algo/DS round with 1 Algorithm Design round and 1 behavioural round. I scheduled my onsite after approximately 30 days of my phone screen.

**Onsite Interviews **

Round 1 (Googlyness)

I think the focus of this round is to eliminate false positives. I made sure to give examples for most of the questions. In retrospect I think this round went well although you can never tell :) .

Round 2 (Technical)

It was fairly easy question on rectangles. I made sure to ask some clarifying questions which helped me narrow down my approach. I could come up with n^2 solution in no time (which i think was the best possible approach). I coded the solution but the interviewer found 1 very small logical bug which I found and corrected. After which there was a follow up question for which I gave couple of different solutions although I am not sure if the interviewer was looking for some thing else. In retropspect I think this round was meh meh.

Round 3 (Technical)

I bombed this interview. It was so bad that after 25 minutes the interviewer gave up and asked me to code it up(I guess he wasn't even looking at the solution). The Question involved thinking along lines of Dp (2D dp Specifically). I was able to figure out the states quite early but it was the transition between the states which I had problem with. In retrospect this round was very bad. If I get denied it will be most certainly because of this round.

Round 4 (Algorithm Design)

The problem statement was quite easy to comprehend although I had to make sure what tradeoffs have to be considered before presenting an optimal solution and refining it further. After I clarified everything I made sure to put a brute force solution and then afterwards an optimal approach using Stacks. The interviewer asked me to code it up which I did. The interviewer looked happy with my code and no modifications was required in the code. The key in this round is to balance thinking part with coding part. In retrospect I think I did well in this round

Round 5 (Technical)

This was my best round. The problem statement was an easy graph problem which I recognized and gave the interviewer the most optimal solution. The interviewer seemed happy with my approach and I coded up instantly in C++. We still had around 15 mins left so there was a follow up question which I was able to explain but there wasn't any coding part involved. In retrospect I think I aced this round.

Post Interview

After 1 week the recruiter reached to me telling that my feedback was tending positive although it's mixed. I was well aware that this was bound to happen. I also have to talk to Managers from different teams this week for Team matching(although I am not sure if this will help Hiring Committee or not). Fingers crossed ð¤. I think I have like 20% chance since I completely bombed one of my interviews. What do you guys think ?

#### Amazon - India
Getting help from the Leetcode community for a long time. I just wanted to give something back as well. :)
I gave an amazon interview last week and wanted to share my experience. I had given an online test prior to the onsites some time back but i do not remember the questions that well. Two weeks later, I was asked to come for onsites.
Pointers before discussing about onsites questions:

Every round was a coding round alongside LP round.
The rounds also consisted of a few questions asked in relation to core subjects like Operating Systems, DBMS, Networks etc.
Each round had atleast two coding questions asked.
Each round went on for atleast an hour in my case
Round 1: I was asked two questions. Both being from leetcode and of medium difficulty. Topics begin Trees and Arrays.

Given a binary tree and a sum. Find if there exists a path from root to leaf with sum of node values to be equal to the target value given.- https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/
I was able to come up with an O(n) solution and was able to code up pretty fast.
Trapping rainwater problem-https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/
This is a pretty well known problem and I did remember it doing a long time back. I had a discussion with the interviewer and was able to come up with an O(n) time and space solution. We went further discussing on STLs in C++ and couple of other topics.
Apart from this there was a resume discussion and couple of LP questions as well.
Round 2: Questions again were from leetcode. The topics asked were from stacks and heaps.

Given a stream of integers, find the median of numbers at any point.
I had never seen this question before hand, but first come up with a brute-force approach, but with a couple of hints from the interviewer I came up with a heap solution there. Later saw that this question is pretty well known leetcode-hard question.
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/
Perform Push, Pop and Get_Min in O(1) complexity.
This question was easy and I had a good discussion with the interviewer about different approaches.
Here I was asked questions from OOPS and Networking. I was able to answer question from OOPS but unable to answer the questions from networking.
Round 3: I was asked three questions in this round. I was asked mostly DP and one Heap question in this round.

The question was given s1, s2, s3, find whether s3 is formed by the interleaving of s1 and s2.
I had never seen this question before and DP being a weak spot for me, I was unable to come up with a DP solution of this problem. I gave a recursive approach but was unable to further optimise it. Later found out that this question was available on leetcode as well.
https://leetcode.com/problems/interleaving-string/
The next question was again from DP, and I had seen the question before. The question was Decode Ways-https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/
I was able to come up with both a tabularised and a recursive approach for this problem. I had a good amount of discussion with the interviewer on this question.
Later on, I was asked the question on K-frequent words from a stream of words incoming. I was able to come up with a brute force solution and then the interviewer asked me to code it up. Post that we had a discussion on everything in relation to designing of the hashmap and priority queues which was in relation to the question.
The interviewer also asked a couple of DBMS questions like ACID properties and some SQL queries.
Round 4: This was the last round. I was asked two questions here. I bombed this interview pretty badly, even though I was able to code it up but I took a lot of time even though the questions weren't that tough.

I was asked a couple of LP questions and things from my resume. Even though I was able to answer LP questions comfortably, I had not revised my resume projects that thoroughly and the interviewer went in depth analysis of my projects where I was unable to answer a couple of questions mainly because I hadn't revised.
It was a graph problem to be done using minheaps. I coded up that solution pretty fast. We had a discussion on minheaps and I was asked to write a code for minheap extraction which was the part where I made a mistake. I got confused in one point and I took a lot of time thinking and kept getting confused further. After sometime, the interviewer started getting slighly frustrated gave me a hint from which I was able to code up the question. I got so nervous and then gave the incorrect complexity analysis of it.
The second question was Word ladder - https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/
I gave the brute force analysis and since I was nervous from the prior mistake I ended up again giving incorrect time complexity analysis. The interviewer helped me a bit further and I was able to come up with a optimised solution but since I had already taken a lot of time, I was unable to code that up.
Mistakes that I actually learnt from after giving the inteviews:

Revise everything on your resume that you think can be asked from you. Getting rejected just because you weren't able to answer something you had done a long time back sucks badly.
Even if you have made mistakes in one round or asked too many hints don't let that boggle you down. Consider every question a new opportunity in that interview irrespective of how the previous one went.
Get your time complexity analysis right. I realised that this concept still is an extremly weak portion of mine.
Interviews are luck based, but the only thing you can do is give your best shot so that you never have regret of not trying.
Rejections happen all the time and I'm pretty sure everyone here must have faced that atleast once. Just take it as a learning experience and move forward. Maybe that company wasn't for you right now, but that doesn't mean it will never be in the future.
I hope this experience is helpful to anyone who is trying in Amazon and I hope you do get in. All the best :)


### Google
#### Google Interview Experience
I think now it's my turn of giving back to the community. I had been recently interviewed at Google, unfortunately couldn't clear it.

Phone Screen:

Problem : Variation of the Course scheduled problem, Given the dependency of the courses, if a course A is prerequisite for course B then course A must be completed in some semester before the semester in which course B is completed, find the minimum no. of semesters required to complete all the courses.

I could solve this problem and then I was invited for the onsite to Google's Hyderabad office. In Hyderabad office, there were five back to back coding rounds and no G & L round.

Round - 1 :

Problem - 1:
You have a machine with one core and you are given start time and end time of the programs, check whether new program can be scheduled or not. You are basically given query describing schedule of the new program i.e, [s, e] s and e are the start and end time of the new program, return true if it can be scheduled, false otherwise.

Follow-up:
Your are given machine with 4 cores (4 programs can run simultaneously) check whether new program can be added or not.

Firstly I gave the brute force solution(O(N)) then I suggested then optimized solution using binary search** O(Log N)**.

Ran out of time for the follow up question, so I could solve this partially.

Round - 2
Problem - 1:
Given an array and an integer K, find the length of longest subarray that has sum less than or equal to K.

First gave O(N2) solution, then gave O(N) solution using sliding window.

Follow-up:
Given a matrix of M * N find the size of the biggest square that has sum less than or equal to K.

First gave brute force solution, then optimzed one using DP.

Problem - 2:
Find the length of longest AP sequence which is there in the tree.

Couldn't solve this one, ran out of time.

Round - 3

Problem - 1:
You are given D units of data that needs to be transferred over the network and packet size K, find minimum no of packets required to transfer all the data.

This was a no brainer, I think this was the warmup problem.

Follow up:
Distribute data in each packet such that difference between data in any two packets should be minimum.

Round - 4:

Given an array of integers that is already sorted based on first 28 bits, solve the array by all the bits.

Couldn't solve this problem

Round - 5:

Problem - 1:

Given a binary locking system, you are also given initial and final state of the lock and all the states that are safe.

From one state you can go to another state by flipping one bit at a time and the new generated state should be same.

You need to check whether you can unlock the given binary lock or not.

Follow Up:
Later he limited the size of safe states to 100 and asked me to optimize.

First I gave the DFS solution, later optimized using DSU. couldn't derive time complexity for this solution.

Lessons Learned

Focus on speed, take the timed contests when you are preparing.
Do not take more than 2-3 minutes to discuss brute force solution.
If you already know the solution, immediately after brute force jump to it, don't waste time in discussing two three alternative approaches.
Many of you may not agree with the third point, but the thing is that when you are interviewing with google, each round last for exactly 45 mins and you are expected to write the complete code.

#### Google 2
I think it's my turn to give back to the wonderful leetcode community. I recently received an offer from Google. Following is my experience.

Journey

I have about 3.5 years of experience working as a Software Engineer. I actively started looking for Job 4 months back wherein I interviewed for Facebook and Google. I got rejected in onsite interviews of Facebook. I have solved around 110 questions on leetcode around 32 Easy 60 Medium and 20 Hard. I have found difficult implementing Hard level leetcode questions (to this date I still do).I didn't want to loose out on any of my options hence I purchased Leetcode premium which was definitely helpful for Facebook's preparation(All the questions I received in my phone screen and onsite were already part of Premium problems)although not that helpful for Google. I tried to solve problems on codeforces and topcoder back during my college days and was on and off with leetcode during past couple of months. In retrospect I should have tried to implement more problems on Leetcode as I have been scared of problems which involve heavy implementation :(

I had already interviewed with Google around 2 years back which went very bad according to the recruiter neverthless I was given one more shot.I thought I would share my Interview experience with Leetcode community below post summarises my Interview experience.

Interview Experience

Phone Screen (45 Minutes)

It was fairly easy question involving priority queue. I had already seen some similar questions hence wasn't difficult for me to come up with approach. The interviewer was happy with the approach and asked me to code it up which I did. Afterwards the interviewer found some syntatical errors in my code which I corrected immediately (nothing logical). I thought I did good.

The recruiter followed up and said the feedback was quite positive and I will move to onsite. She told me that there will be 3 Algo/DS round with 1 Algorithm Design round and 1 behavioural round. I scheduled my onsite after approximately 30 days of my phone screen.

**Onsite Interviews **

Round 1 (Googlyness)

I think the focus of this round is to eliminate false positives. I made sure to give examples for most of the questions. In retrospect I think this round went well although you can never tell :) .

Round 2 (Technical)

It was fairly easy question on rectangles. I made sure to ask some clarifying questions which helped me narrow down my approach. I could come up with n^2 solution in no time (which i think was the best possible approach). I coded the solution but the interviewer found 1 very small logical bug which I found and corrected. After which there was a follow up question for which I gave couple of different solutions although I am not sure if the interviewer was looking for some thing else. In retropspect I think this round was meh meh.

Round 3 (Technical)

I bombed this interview. It was so bad that after 25 minutes the interviewer gave up and asked me to code it up(I guess he wasn't even looking at the solution). The Question involved thinking along lines of Dp (2D dp Specifically). I was able to figure out the states quite early but it was the transition between the states which I had problem with. In retrospect this round was very bad. If I get denied it will be most certainly because of this round.

Round 4 (Algorithm Design)

The problem statement was quite easy to comprehend although I had to make sure what tradeoffs have to be considered before presenting an optimal solution and refining it further. After I clarified everything I made sure to put a brute force solution and then afterwards an optimal approach using Stacks. The interviewer asked me to code it up which I did. The interviewer looked happy with my code and no modifications was required in the code. The key in this round is to balance thinking part with coding part. In retrospect I think I did well in this round

Round 5 (Technical)

This was my best round. The problem statement was an easy graph problem which I recognized and gave the interviewer the most optimal solution. The interviewer seemed happy with my approach and I coded up instantly in C++. We still had around 15 mins left so there was a follow up question which I was able to explain but there wasn't any coding part involved. In retrospect I think I aced this round.

Post Interview

After 1 week the recruiter reached to me telling that my feedback was tending positive although it's mixed. I was well aware that this was bound to happen. I also have to talk to Managers from different teams this week for Team matching(although I am not sure if this will help Hiring Committee or not). Fingers crossed ð¤. I think I have like 20% chance since I completely bombed one of my interviews. What do you guys think ?

#### Amazon - India
Getting help from the Leetcode community for a long time. I just wanted to give something back as well. :)
I gave an amazon interview last week and wanted to share my experience. I had given an online test prior to the onsites some time back but i do not remember the questions that well. Two weeks later, I was asked to come for onsites.
Pointers before discussing about onsites questions:

Every round was a coding round alongside LP round.
The rounds also consisted of a few questions asked in relation to core subjects like Operating Systems, DBMS, Networks etc.
Each round had atleast two coding questions asked.
Each round went on for atleast an hour in my case
Round 1: I was asked two questions. Both being from leetcode and of medium difficulty. Topics begin Trees and Arrays.

Given a binary tree and a sum. Find if there exists a path from root to leaf with sum of node values to be equal to the target value given.- https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/
I was able to come up with an O(n) solution and was able to code up pretty fast.
Trapping rainwater problem-https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/
This is a pretty well known problem and I did remember it doing a long time back. I had a discussion with the interviewer and was able to come up with an O(n) time and space solution. We went further discussing on STLs in C++ and couple of other topics.
Apart from this there was a resume discussion and couple of LP questions as well.
Round 2: Questions again were from leetcode. The topics asked were from stacks and heaps.

Given a stream of integers, find the median of numbers at any point.
I had never seen this question before hand, but first come up with a brute-force approach, but with a couple of hints from the interviewer I came up with a heap solution there. Later saw that this question is pretty well known leetcode-hard question.
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/
Perform Push, Pop and Get_Min in O(1) complexity.
This question was easy and I had a good discussion with the interviewer about different approaches.
Here I was asked questions from OOPS and Networking. I was able to answer question from OOPS but unable to answer the questions from networking.
Round 3: I was asked three questions in this round. I was asked mostly DP and one Heap question in this round.

The question was given s1, s2, s3, find whether s3 is formed by the interleaving of s1 and s2.
I had never seen this question before and DP being a weak spot for me, I was unable to come up with a DP solution of this problem. I gave a recursive approach but was unable to further optimise it. Later found out that this question was available on leetcode as well.
https://leetcode.com/problems/interleaving-string/
The next question was again from DP, and I had seen the question before. The question was Decode Ways-https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/
I was able to come up with both a tabularised and a recursive approach for this problem. I had a good amount of discussion with the interviewer on this question.
Later on, I was asked the question on K-frequent words from a stream of words incoming. I was able to come up with a brute force solution and then the interviewer asked me to code it up. Post that we had a discussion on everything in relation to designing of the hashmap and priority queues which was in relation to the question.
The interviewer also asked a couple of DBMS questions like ACID properties and some SQL queries.
Round 4: This was the last round. I was asked two questions here. I bombed this interview pretty badly, even though I was able to code it up but I took a lot of time even though the questions weren't that tough.

I was asked a couple of LP questions and things from my resume. Even though I was able to answer LP questions comfortably, I had not revised my resume projects that thoroughly and the interviewer went in depth analysis of my projects where I was unable to answer a couple of questions mainly because I hadn't revised.
It was a graph problem to be done using minheaps. I coded up that solution pretty fast. We had a discussion on minheaps and I was asked to write a code for minheap extraction which was the part where I made a mistake. I got confused in one point and I took a lot of time thinking and kept getting confused further. After sometime, the interviewer started getting slighly frustrated gave me a hint from which I was able to code up the question. I got so nervous and then gave the incorrect complexity analysis of it.
The second question was Word ladder - https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/
I gave the brute force analysis and since I was nervous from the prior mistake I ended up again giving incorrect time complexity analysis. The interviewer helped me a bit further and I was able to come up with a optimised solution but since I had already taken a lot of time, I was unable to code that up.
Mistakes that I actually learnt from after giving the inteviews:

Even if you have made mistakes in one round or asked too many hints don't let that boggle you down. Consider every question a new opportunity in that interview irrespective of how the previous one went.

I hope this experience is helpful to anyone who is trying in Amazon and I hope you do get in. All the best :)
