### Relations

For two sets \\(A, B\\), a `relation` \\(R\\) is a __subset__ of \\(A\times B\\). It is denoted as
\\[R=aRb\quad \text\{ or \} \quad R:A\mapsto B\\]
* `domain` of \\(R, \text\{ dom\}R := \\{x\in A \\ \|\\  \exists y\in B : (x,y)\in R\\}\\)
* `range` or `image` of \\(R, \text\{ Im\}R := \\{y\in B \\ \|\\ \exists x\in A : (x,y)\in R\\}\\)
* `codomain` of \\(R: B\\).
* `inverse relation` of \\(R, R^\{-1\}:=\\{(y,x)\in B\times A \\ \|\\ (x,y)\in R\\}\\)

For 3 sets \\(A,B,C\\) and two relations \\(R:A\mapsto B, S:B\mapsto A\\), define their `composition` as
\\[S\circ R := \\{(x,z)\in (A, C) \\ \|\\ \exists y \in B : (x,y)\in R \land (y,z)\in S\\}\\]
Also for \\(R: A\mapsto B\\), 
* \\(R\\) is `reflexive` : \\(x\in A \quad\Rightarrow\quad (x,x)\in R\\)
* \\(R\\) is `symmetric` : \\((x,y)\in R \quad\Rightarrow\quad (y,x)\in R\\)
* \\(R\\) is `transitive` : \\((x,y) \in R, (y,z)\in R \quad\Rightarrow\quad (x,z)\in R\\)
* A reflexive, symmetric and transitive relation is called a `equivalent relation`. 

For any non-empty set \\(A\\), \\(\bigtriangleup_A =\\{(x,y)\in A\times A \\ \|\\ x=y\\}\\) is __the smallest__ relation on \\(A\\). It is often called a `diagonal relation`. (And also notice that we can use symbol = without defining a equivalent relation)

### Order Relation

For \\(R:A\mapsto A\\), define
* \\(R\\) is `antisymmetric` : \\((x,y)\in R \land (y,x)\in R \quad\Rightarrow\quad x=y\\)
* A reflexive, transitive and antisymmetric relation is called a `order relation`.

### Partition and Equivalent Class

For a equivalent relation \\(R:A\mapsto A\\), define the `equivalent class` of \\(x\in A\\) by the \\(R\\) as
\\[[x]_R := \\{y\in A \\ \| \\ (x,y)\in R\\}\\]
A set of all equivalent class over the set \\(A\\) by the \\(R\\) is called a `quotient set`, and denoted
\\[A \backslash R\\]

If a set \\(P\\) of subsets of \\(A\\) satisfies
* \\(P\\) is not empty
* elements of \\(P\\) are M.E, and C.E.

Then we call \\(P\\) as a 'partition` of \\(A\\).

Based on the definition,
1. a quotient set by some equivalent relation \\(R\\) \\(A\backslash R\\) is a partition of \\(A\\). Therefore, if there exists a equivalent relation, then there exists at least 1 partition.
2. If there is a partition \\(P\\) over \\(A\\), then we can define a equivalent relation by
\\[R:=\\{(x,y)\in A\times A \\ \| \\ \exists p\in P : (x,y)\in p\\}\\]

In conclusion,
\\[R \text\{ is a equivalent relation over \}A \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \exists \text\{a partition of \} A\\]
