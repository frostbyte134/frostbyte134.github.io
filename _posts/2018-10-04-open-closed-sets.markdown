With the concept of distance defined in a metric space, we can talk about the limit, and openness/closedness of a set.



### Definitions

* `segment` \\(a,b\\) in \\(\mathbb\{R\}\\): \\(\\{x\in\mathbb\{R\} \\ \| \\ a < x < b\\}\\)
* `k-cell` : segments in \\(\mathbb\{R\}^k\\)

Let \\(X\\) be a metric space. All points and set mentioned below are understood to be the elements / subsets of \\(X\\)
* `neightborhood` of \\(p\\) with radius \\(r, N\_r(p)\\): a set \\(\\{x\in X \\ \| \\ \|x-p\|<r\\}\\)  
is denoted as a `open circle` in Euclidean space.
* `limit point` \\(p\\) of a set \\(E\\): Every neightborhood of \\(p\\) constains a point \\(q\neq p\\) such that \\(q\in E\\)
* `isolated point` \\(p\\) of a set \\(E\\): \\(p\in E\\) but \\(p\\) is not an limit point
