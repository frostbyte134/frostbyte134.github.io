### Field of view and focal length

1. \\(\tan(\frac\{\theta\}\{2\})=\frac\{l\}\{2f\}\\)  
where l=sensor size (mm), f=working distance (or, focal length in milimeter)
2. Focal length = f/l. Remember that, the point (1, 1) on the normalized plane has to be projected to (f_x, f_y) on the image plane.
