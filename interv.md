1. ROS : Robotics middleware. Although ROS is not an operating system, it provides services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster such as hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management.

Software in the ROS Ecosystem[6] can be separated into three groups:
* language-and platform-independent tools used for building and distributing ROS-based software;
* ROS client library implementations such as roscpp,[7] rospy,[8] and roslisp;[9]
* packages containing application-related code which uses one or more ROS client libraries.[10]
